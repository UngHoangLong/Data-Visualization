# Data-Visualization
This is a personal project of mine on the topic of Data Visualization

Analyzing the Impact of Recession on Automobile Sales
You have been hired by XYZAutomotives as a data scientist. Your first task is to analyze the historical data and
give the company directors insights on how the sales were affected during times of recession. You will provide a
number of charts/plots to visualize the data and make it easy for the directors to understand your analysis.
